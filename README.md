# A Metal Slug Game
This is my Final Project for ECE385 - Digital System Lab
## Introduction
In this Final Project of ECE385, we built a “Metal Slug” game based on the knowledge we have learned through the semester. We designed and implemented the 2D video on the FPGA. The main character is controlled by a P/S 2 keyboard inputs with forward, backward, and jump motion. It has two more keyboard inputs to attack (melee) and shoot rocket (range). We designed a background and stage for the game. The main character needs to eliminate aggressive opponents in order to pass the game. The aggressive opponents will have their  own AI to move and attack. The main character has a health bar, and the player will lose if the health bar drops to 0. After the player reached the final checkpoint, “mission complete” would be displayed at the center of the screen, and the player will change into a tank.
